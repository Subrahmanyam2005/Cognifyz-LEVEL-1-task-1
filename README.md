Task: Temperature Converter

Description: Create a program that converts

temperatures between Celsius and

Fahrenheit. Prompt the user to enter a

temperature value and the unit of

measurement, and then perform the

conversion. Display the converted

temperature.

Skills: Basic input/output operations,

arithmetic operations.
🚀 Temperature Converter Program in Java

🌡️ Project Overview:
I recently created a simple Temperature Converter program in Java. This program takes a temperature value and its unit (Celsius or Fahrenheit) as input, performs the conversion, and displays the result.

🔑 Key Features:

Converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Utilizes basic input/output operations for user interaction.

Implements arithmetic operations for accurate conversions.

Includes error handling for invalid unit inputs.


🛠️ How It Works:

1. User Input: The user enters a temperature value and specifies the unit (C for Celsius or F for Fahrenheit).


2. Conversion Logic:

Celsius to Fahrenheit: 

Fahrenheit to Celsius: 



3. Output: The program displays the converted temperature with the appropriate unit.



💻 Why This Project?

This project helped me enhance my skills in:

Java programming fundamentals

Handling user inputs and validations

Understanding real-world applications of arithmetic operations


👩‍💻 Code Snippet:

if (unit == 'C') {
    convertedTemperature = (temperature * 9 / 5) + 32;
    System.out.printf("The converted temperature is: %.2f Fahrenheit", convertedTemperature);
} else if (unit == 'F') {
    convertedTemperature = (temperature - 32) * 5 / 9;
    System.out.printf("The converted temperature is: %.2f Celsius", convertedTemperature);
} else {
    System.out.println("Invalid unit. Please enter 'C' or 'F'.");
}

🌟 This project is a great starting point for anyone learning Java basics and looking to create simple yet functional applications.

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions for improvements! 😊
